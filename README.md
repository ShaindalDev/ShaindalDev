### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Robin, im a 37 year old junior Frontend developer from Norway. I'm currently enrolled at Noroff school of technology and digital media at the course Digital Marketing. I have 24 years of experiance with IT, computers and telecom, also worked alot with costumer service. I'm studying Digital Marketing in my own sparetime when im not involved in projects or school work.

I like making or partake in making solutions that will benefit all users of a project/site/app / software or system. I do like keeping the user experiance of things a priority as far as possible. 

I also have a passion for project management and photography. Photography is at the moment a hobby activity i do when i see the opportunities of a good photo. 
Project management is something i enjoy doing since i have a very active mindset and i need order and structure in things

Im a person with overflow in the imagination department, and i like to think about new or better ways of doing things.
